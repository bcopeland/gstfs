To install, normally one just needs:

    $ ./configure && make

And optionally,

    $ sudo make install 

If building from git, you need autotools (autoconf/automake) installed.
The config script uses m4 macros from pkg-config, and one from
autoconf-archive to test pthreads.  With these installed, just do:

    $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

See the included scripts for example use.
